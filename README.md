# blackwhitefaceDetector


## Black and White Face Detector
### Overview
The "Black and White Face Detector" is a computer vision project aimed at developing a robust and accurate model for detecting black and white faces in images. This project leverages deep learning techniques and sophisticated image processing to identify and classify faces based on their ethnicity.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is rooted in the need for fair and unbiased facial recognition systems. Many existing facial recognition algorithms suffer from racial bias, particularly in their performance on black and white faces. By building a specialized face detector for these groups, we aim to mitigate bias and improve the overall accuracy of facial recognition technology.

### Features
<ol>
<li> Face Detection: The core feature of this project is its ability to detect faces within images accurately.</li>

<li> Ethnicity Classification: In addition to detecting faces, the model can classify them as either black or white, contributing to comprehensive demographic analysis. </li>

<li> Data Preprocessing: Robust data preprocessing techniques ensure high-quality training data and reduce noise in the dataset. </li>

<li> Bias Mitigation: Efforts are made to curate a balanced dataset that minimizes bias and ensures fair representation of both black and white faces. </li>
</ol>

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the "Black and White Face Detector" project:

Installation: Install the necessary dependencies, including DeepFace and any other required libraries.

Data Collection: Collect a diverse dataset of black and white faces for training and testing. Ensure that the dataset is labeled appropriately.

Data Preprocessing: Use data preprocessing techniques to clean and augment the dataset, ensuring it is of high quality and free from noise.

Model Training: Train the face detection and classification model using the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on test data to assess its accuracy and bias mitigation.

Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-world applications, such as facial recognition systems or demographic analysis tools.
